- name: Authentication changes in version 10.4 message
  debug:
    msg: >
      Authentication has changed in version 10.4. Both the root user and
      the user that owns the data directory (mysql by default) now utilize
      the unix_socket plugin for passwordless access, and are created with
      an invalid password. Therefore setting a password isn't required for
      those user accounts accessing via the unix socket. Please see
      https://mariadb.org/authentication-in-mariadb-10-4/ .
